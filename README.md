# Jquery Server Calculator
## Description

This here is a single expression/operator calculator. This calculator allows you to save a log of all run calculations until the server is restarted. It does not take multiple operators and will throw an error as of now for those inputs.

Future updates will take all multiple numerical characters/operators and evaluate them properly.
